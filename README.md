# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Model-2

Developed machine learning models for mortality status classification and survival period estimation using real-world breast cancer patient data. Implemented Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Ensemble Learning in Python. Optimized models using hyperparameter tuning and evaluated performance with AUC-ROC, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
